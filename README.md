### Web Scraping Project: Building a Book Dashboard! 

I recently undertook a small but fascinating web scraping project that allowed me to dive into the world of data extraction and visualization. Using Python and my curiosity for exploring the digital realm, I embarked on a journey to gather insightful information from the 'www.livrariacultura.com.br/livros' website.

Here's a quick rundown of what I accomplished:

- Web Scraping Marvel: I navigated the virtual aisles of 'www.livrariacultura.com.br/livros' to extract data that sparked my interest.

- Categories and Links Unveiled: I uncovered all the categories available on the website along with their respective links. It was like opening the doors to a treasure trove of literary wonders!

- Diving into Book Details: Within each category, I harvested the titles of the books, the brilliant minds behind them (authors), the price tags, and even managed to snag captivating book covers.

- Dataframe Magic: With the gathered information, I skillfully wove together a structured dataframe. Each book found its home in the right category, accompanied by its details. The result was a cohesive collection of literary gems waiting to be explored.

- From Data to Dashboard: But why stop at just numbers and text? I transformed this data into a visually pleasing dashboard using Flourish (https://bit.ly/3sCcapF) . The dashboard became a window into the world of books, enabling users to interact with and explore the data in an engaging way.

- This project was more than just extracting data; it was an exercise in combining technical skills with an appreciation for literature. It taught me the art of data curation and presentation, allowing me to tell a story through numbers and visuals.
